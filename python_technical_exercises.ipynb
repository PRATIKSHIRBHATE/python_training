    "Welcome to the technical exercises for python training session. These hands-on exercises are aimed at helping you get more comfortable with manipulating data in python and should provide you with a basic foundation for working with data from the CADW. Please answer the questions below and document your code to call out your answer. We will review the correct answers and provide examples of code at a later training session. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Michael Voss on the Data Science Team.\n",
